# python-age-of-mythology-portrait-maker
This is a portrait editing tool made for Age of Mythology: Extended Edition, this tool makes it easy for anyone to replace any god portait in the game.

This tool also makes it easy to upload your mod to the steam workshop, it exports with the correct folder structure, a default image and an empty readme that you can change.

Supported image formats: PNG, JPEG (might add more later)

# Setup
download this repo as a zip file or clone it to your computer, then open the folder in a code editor (i use visual studio code) and run app.py.

# Step One
create a new mod or use the demo mod to try it out.

# Step Two
change the workshop image and readme if you want to, it's not needed for the mod to work but if you are going to upload your mod to the steam workshop i would recommend it.
